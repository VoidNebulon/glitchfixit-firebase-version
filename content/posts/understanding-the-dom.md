## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages like JavaScript can connect to the page.

## How React Interacts with the DOM

Libraries like React abstract away direct DOM manipulation. Instead of writing `document.getElementById` and manually changing elements, you declare what you want the UI to look like in JSX. React then takes care of updating the DOM efficiently to match your declared state. This is often done using a "Virtual DOM" to minimize expensive direct updates to the real DOM.

## Why it Still Matters

Even when using a framework, understanding the DOM is crucial for debugging and for performance optimization. Knowing how the browser renders a page and how your framework interacts with it will make you a more effective web developer.
