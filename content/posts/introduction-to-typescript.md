## JavaScript with Superpowers

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. By adding types, you can catch errors during development that you would otherwise only find at runtime. This leads to more robust and maintainable code, especially in large projects.

## Basic Types

You can add type annotations to your variables and function parameters.

`let myName: string = "Susan";
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}`

If you try to assign a number to `myName` or pass a number to `greet`, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error before you even run the code.

## The Power of Interfaces

Interfaces are a powerful way to define the "shape" of an object. They are a core part of using TypeScript effectively and help ensure your data structures are consistent throughout your application.

`interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}`
