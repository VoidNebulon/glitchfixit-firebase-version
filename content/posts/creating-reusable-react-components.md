## The DRY Principle

"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) is a fundamental principle of software development. In React, this means creating reusable components. A well-designed component can be used in multiple places throughout your application, saving you time and making your code easier to maintain.

## Composition over Inheritance

React favors a compositional model. Instead of creating complex component hierarchies through inheritance, you should build complex UI by composing simpler components. The `children` prop is a powerful mechanism for this.

`function Card({ children }) {
  return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
}`

## Props as an API

Think of your component's props as its public API. Design them to be clear, concise, and flexible. Use `PropTypes` or TypeScript to document and enforce the expected props, making your components easier for other developers (and your future self) to use.
