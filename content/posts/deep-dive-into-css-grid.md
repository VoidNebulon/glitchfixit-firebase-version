## The Power of Grid

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.

## Defining a Grid

To get started, you create a grid container by declaring `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid` on an element. Then, you can define the structure of your grid using properties like `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.

`.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}`

This creates a simple three-column grid with equal-width columns and a 1rem gap between grid items.

## Placing Items

You can explicitly place items within the grid using `grid-column` and `grid-row`, or you can let the browser's auto-placement algorithm handle it for you. This flexibility is what makes Grid so powerful for complex layouts.
