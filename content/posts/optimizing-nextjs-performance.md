## Why Performance Matters

Web performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Slow-loading websites can lead to high bounce rates and poor search engine rankings. Next.js provides many features out-of-the-box to help you build high-performance applications.

## Image Optimization

Images are often the largest assets on a webpage. The built-in `next/image` component automatically optimizes images for you by resizing, compressing, and serving them in modern formats like WebP. Always use `next/image` instead of the standard `<img>` tag.

## Dynamic Imports

To reduce the initial JavaScript bundle size, use dynamic imports for components that are not visible on the initial page load. This can significantly improve your application's Time to Interactive (TTI).

`import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const MyHeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyHeavyComponent'))`

Now, `MyHeavyComponent` will only be loaded when it's rendered.
