## Beyond console.log

We've all been there: littering our code with `console.log` statements to figure out what's going on. But there's a better way! Browser developer tools offer powerful debugging features that can save you a ton of time.

## Breakpoints

The most powerful tool is the breakpoint. By adding a breakpoint in your code (either directly in the Sources panel or by adding a `debugger;` statement), you can pause the execution of your code and inspect the state of your application at that exact moment. You can see the call stack, check the values of variables in scope, and step through your code line by line.

## Conditional Breakpoints

For loops or frequently called functions, a simple breakpoint can be overwhelming. A conditional breakpoint only pauses execution if a certain condition is met. This is incredibly useful for isolating a bug that only happens in a specific scenario.
