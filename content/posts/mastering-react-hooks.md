## Introduction to Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write components. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. In this post, we'll dive deep into the most common hooks and how to use them effectively.

## useState: The Bread and Butter

The `useState` hook is the most fundamental hook. It allows you to add state to your functional components.

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

This simple line gives you a state variable `count` and a function `setCount` to update it.

## useEffect: Handling Side Effects

Side effects, like fetching data or subscribing to events, are handled with `useEffect`. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs by passing a dependency array.

`useEffect(() => {
  document.title = \`You clicked \${count} times\`;
}, [count]);`

This effect will only re-run if the `count` variable changes.

## Conclusion

Hooks are a powerful tool in any React developer's arsenal. By mastering `useState` and `useEffect`, you're well on your way to writing cleaner, more maintainable React applications.
